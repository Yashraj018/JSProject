Room Rental 4 You is a website created to find the perfect accommodation for the user in the different cities. It was my own idea to develop something like this  that's why I choose this project. In this project I basically used HTML and CSS and JavaScript. I searched few media query  properties on google. And then implemented to the project.

The main feature of this project is user are able to like any vacant space, add the favorite space to the cart and also able to fill the forms.  It contains three images taken from unsplash.
